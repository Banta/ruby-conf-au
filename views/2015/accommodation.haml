    %p If you're travelling from interstate or overseas, you're likely looking for a place to stay in Melbourne for the duration of the conference. We've got a couple of deals lined up at hotels in the heart of the city (both an easy walk from our venue, Deakin Edge at Fed Square).

To book call <strong>+61 3 9250 1888</strong> or email <a href="mailto:res.melbourne@rendezvoushotels.com">res.melbourne@rendezvoushotels.com</a> and quote "<strong>Ruby Conf Australia 2015</strong>" to have access to these special rates.

    %p Of course, there are many other options you may wish to explore. Have a look on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/s/Melbourne-CBD--Victoria--Australia">Airbnb</a>, <a href="http://www.wotif.com/hotels/landmarks/australia/federation-square-hotels.html">Wotif</a>, and <a href="http://www.booking.com/district/au/melbourne/cbd.en-gb.html">Booking.com</a>.

    %p Public transport in Melbourne is (mostly) reliable, so you could always stay further afield and take a train or tram into the city. Fitzroy, Collingwood, North Melbourne, Richmond and South Yarra are suburbs that are all quite close with decent transport options. Feel free to send us questions <a href="https://twitter.com/rubyconf_au">on Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:organisers@rubyconf.org.au">by email</a> if you're unsure which options will suit you best.
