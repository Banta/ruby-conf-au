      %p
        Pat earns his keep as a freelance web and Ruby developer based in the coworking space of Inspire9 in Melbourne, Australia. Often, though, you'll find him travelling around the world, attending interesting events and meeting interesting people.

        As well as working with talented development teams and writing open source Ruby libraries, he's a fan of bringing people together for gatherings small and large, including Trampoline and Rails Camp. And if you ask him nicely, he might even cook you a pancake.

      %h3 Amy Hoy
      %p
        Amy started coding at age of six. And designing web sites at age of ten. And she hated working for bigcos and startups, but it taught her a lot, namely: Nobody "in charge" knows what they're doing, so why not do it herself&hellip; and keep all the money? So she set out to use her skills to bootstrap, and recruited her husband as well. In December, Freckle&mdash;their web app&mdash;crossed $1M in lifetime revenue. Now she is writing this bio at home, with her cats, in her Jessica London full-body fleece robe, as she contemplates a trip to Australia where people will come to see her rant about marketing on stage. All thanks to research and tiny but continuous execution. Boring but profitable.

      %h3 Testing Zero to Hero
      %h4 So testing&hellip; How does it work?

      %p What is a unit test? Why is that an integration test, should I even bother with acceptance tests?

      %p Let's work through the differences between the various types of testing, look at differing strategies for tackling problems and how they can be solved. Try doing things with TDD, try doing things building tests after.

      %p Let's use RSpec, TestUnit and MiniSpec to test different techniques and perfect our tests. And we will look at how we can apply these to our real world problems to make our lives easier and our software better!

      %h3 Building C Extensions in Ruby
      %h4 You will learn how amazingly simple it is to build high-performance extensions that leverage existing C libraries.

      %p You’ll receive a basic notion of the C language, and then you will dive into the various Ruby APIs that allow you to bridge C code to our favourite language.

      %p We will also go through a heavy testing component that will help you ensure that your extension works as intended, and remains as bulletproof as possible.

      %h3 Screw the &#8220;Great Idea&#8221; Before It Screws You
      %h4 Learn to avoid the highs and lows of idea worship, and read your customers' minds for real cash dollars

      %p You can build it. But will they come? More importantly&hellip; will they pay? Design and development skills are incredibly valuable in today's employment economy, obviously. But despite media "hacker" worship, those skills don't, alas, come packaged with a magical ability to know what real live customers will pay for.

      %p The good news is: it's not a magical ability at all. You can learn it. And once you can read your customers' minds, you can design products that they'll need and want&mdash;with features they'll use&mdash;and marketing that they'll want to read and share. It's the best abstraction ever. This workshop will teach you how to spot the hidden, super valuable insights that are all around you.

      %h4 Take the next step in your coding journey!

      %p Join us and continue the learning you started at Rails Girls. Since you have Ruby installed already, we can jump right in!

      %p We've organised three mentor-led tutorials that will help you dive deeper into the world of professional development with Ruby. Tutorials include a look at some of Ruby's more advanced features and syntax, building a Sinatra app and deploying it, test-driven development and more.

      %p Lastly, you will gain a greater appreciation of development work procedures by pairing up to solve coding challenges and using Git for version control.
